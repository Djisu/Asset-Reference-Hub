# Asset-Reference-Hub
An app for an assets reference. Asset details are stored on the app.
When a user get to the app, he/she can straight away view the details of the assets already captured on the app. 
A user is required to create a profile on the app. This will allow the user to enter some few personal details.
Then this profile will allow the user to enter details of the asset he/she wants to show to the world, including the image of the asset. The image is separately stored in Cloudinary, a cloud repository for images.
Banks can come to the app and find out if asset is used as colateral for a previous loan or not.
It was developed using Mongodb, Express, React/Redux and Node.
